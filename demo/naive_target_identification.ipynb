How many doses of Zithromax have you given your child already. Usually, it takes 48 hours before you can see the effect of the antibiotics (like the fever goes down or may completely go away, child is regaining appetite) provided you give the proper dose as prescribed. Remember that the cough is the last to go away. If after 48 hrs your child worsens, it is best to bring to the hospital. Does your child have any history of asthma or allergic rhinitis. If yes, usually the course of a respiratory infection is prolonged. I hope your child feels better soon. Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D. Pediatrician\",\n",

I also had a bone dinstanted test done and the result show that I have artisitha in the lower part of my back. Sometimes I can not lay on my right side because it cause me pain. That is the same side where the nagging pain is in my thigh. It mostly only happen when I go to bed Doctor: Hi, A back pain along with radiating to thighs can be attributed to sciatica in which a nerve gets impinged along its route, and it causes pain. So to treat it conservatively sleep on hard bed that too straight with a small cushion under your knees will relieve the tension on nerve and will relieve you paint times while you are travelling use of lumber corset will help in preventing any further trauma, have your blood calcium, it d and it b-12 levels check as there below normal levels will worsen the condition. Travel light if your work require you to travel. In diet have lots of green vegetables, fluids and have b12 supplements as (it B 12 is a euro tonic) do lightweight exercises and low impact aerobics like cycling and swimming) and maintain correct posture and ergonomics like sitting straight. Correct ways to use computers and mobiles as maintaining wrong postures worsens the condition. If pain is affecting mostly while going to bed consider sleeping on hard bed or consider changing your mattress to half inch memory form mattress. Hope you find the answer useful.

       "  'Patient: Hello.I am 44 years old, and I am a seaman. Very often I was exposed to stressful situation, until about a year ago I had panic attack. I was feeling very scared when I was alone, thinking that I am going to die, I could not sleep in my bed because of some fear. If i have slept 2 hours I was awaking in panic and fear. Could not stay alone, could not concentrate on my job, constantly having bad thoughts passing through my mind. I have visited doctor who gave me Deanxit tablets, and after first one i felt amazingly better, only i had trouble sleeping. I was taking two tablets per day for about a month, than I signed off from the ship and stop with Deanxit. During vacation I have visited psychiatrist, explained what happened to me, and he told me that I have suffered panic attack. My psychiatrist has prescribed me SEROXAT - Paroxetin tablets, 20 mg, if happens againAfter two months at home, where everything was ok, only trouble sleeping from time to time, I have signed on another ship, and situation has started but not that strong as before.I have started taking Seroxat and everything was ok, only trouble sleeping again, and I have been taking Seroxat for full 4 months while I was on board the ship.Another two  months at home without tablets, but again trouble sleeping, and here I am on my present vessel, just signed on today.After talking with my family I am sensing and experiencing some kind of fear, now when I am alone in my room.Fear comes and goes, but I am still kind of afraid to go to sleep, even I am very tired.Thinking about taking Seroxat again or maybe Deanxit.Could you please tell me what to do and how and if is possible to treat this fear permanently.Thank you very much.

But I had a UA done about a month ago that came back with abnormal WBC when culture and sensitivity was done it came back negative. At urgent care today my Bloodwork came back fine but my UA showed 500 count leukocytes. I m going to have ct done of gallbladder . I am a 20 year old female , any idea what could be wrong Doctor: Hi young lady, you do have both gastrointestinal and urinary problems from the information provided. The CT scan will give us some information about how your kidneys and gallbladder look. Are you having any white discharge per vagina which is contaminating the urine? Infection of the urinary tract is the most common cause of pus cells in the urine. Repeat the culture. If repeated cultures are negative and there is no kidney stone on CT scan, you will need tests to look for causes of Sterile Syria. Blood in stools is not due to gallstones nor urine infection - it needs further assessment. Most commonly it is due to hemorrhoids (piles), but a doctor (surgeon/ GP) should examine you to confirm or negate this.',\n",

Doctor: Hi, Overdosing up to two pills is done to make up for a missed pill, but taking four pills at a time is not going to help make up the missed doses and the cycle is no longer protected. You may also see a breakthrough bleeding due to excessive hormone levels. Other side effects like rashes, nausea, breast tenderness or abdominal pain, apart from vascular disturbances, may also be seen with high doses. I do not think you should be using some other form of pill once you are on Diane 35. You are amply protected if you are regular with your medication. Hope this helps.',\n",

How is he after you give the fever medicine? Is he active and eating well? Fever can be due to a viral or bacterial infection. Aside from the throat pain, does he have colds or cough? For most viral infections, the patients appear well after given antipyretic (fever medicine like Eugenic or Paracetamol) in between fever episodes. The throat infection caused by viruses is usually accompanied by colds. Viral infections are not given antibiotics like Azithromycin or Brian. It is mainly supportive like giving fever medicine, lots of fluids, antibacterial gargle. Fever caused by viral infections can last from 3 days to a week. After 3 days, you will notice the fever to go down and the patient will show improvement already. You may try to check his throat to see if the tonsils are red and swollen sometimes with streaks of pus. If you see this, chances are the throat infection is caused by a bacteria like streptococcus or what we call as the strep throat. Patients who have strep throat can also have severe headache, difficulty swallowing, sometimes with rashes. Bacterial throat infection will be more sick looking compared to that caused by viruses. For this you will need antibiotics that is properly computed based on your children weight. I hope I was able to help you. Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D. Pediatrics\",\n",

       "  'Patient: hi ive been suffering lower abdominal pain now for 7 months ive been to the gp numerous times and have been referred for an ultrasound scan, recently after sexual intercourse i started bleeding bright red fresh blood, after the intercourse myself and my partner could feel like a lump on the front wall of my cervix and abdominal pain increased Doctor: Hi, thank you for your query, Vaginal bleeding, and a cervical mass may indicate the presence of malignancy. Also, moderate pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge are symptoms of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a malignant neoplasm arising from cells originating in the cervix uteri. The pain in your lower abdomen is mostly because of the lump on the cervix. The most common cause for cervical cancer is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)At this point i would suggest you to undergo a basic Pap Screening and a further Biopsy of the lump to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on that your OB/GUN will start the prescribed treatment.thanking you, wishing you good health',\n",

I can be wrong but i would like to investigate my grandmother death because something doesnt seem right. She was 75 year old and the doctor just found out she had gallbladder cancer and they had surgery on her and tried to cut it and he said it spreaded. I thought thats very high risk with her being that old. Ever scince then my poor grandmother. Could not eat,talk,smile she couldnt even open her eyes.they put her in hospice she didnt even stay in their for a week she passed within 2days. I want to get to the bottom of this because it doesnt sound right. She couldnt even say anything to any of her kids and grandkids before she passed away. Someone please help me! Doctor: Gall bladder cancers are silent killers. By the time the cancer is detected the tumor will have usually spread to the liver making treatment futile and survival poor. Surgery attempts at removing as much of the tumor mass as possible in order to reduce the tumor load to prolong life and make the residual tumor more susceptible to anti-cancer Chat Doctor. Overall prognosis in gall bladder tumors is very poor.',\n",

Ive been dating this girl with it and she rarely gets cold sores to me i beleive its minor but i never get more information about it from her and i researched alot about it lately but everything is still the same. She told me she would tell me if she had a breakout but im scared and i really care about her. I sometimes afraid to kiss her even when her face is clear (which it usually always is). Can you please help me with some information on being able to coup with it and if i would be able to show any affection to her at all? Doctor: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint Herpes type 1 infection causes cold sores over the lips and face and commonly involves the lips. In case if a person has a history of cold sores he/she tend to transmit infection to other individuals by close contact like kissing and using things like glass, towels etc. But in case if there is no cold sore present then the viral count seems to be very low over the skin of infected individual, although it does not become zero. But in this condition the individual is considered clean and chances for other person to get infected are less.Moreover, you can go for her blood investigation to rule out for viral count so that the exact status can be clear. But in case if her skin is completely clear then you are at a lesser risk of getting infected. She should also take a long course of antiviral medications to prevent recurring episodes of outbreak of infection. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.',\n",

What is this? and is it normal? Thanks Lishai Doctor: Hallow Lisa, The baby inside the uterus is continually moving. It is calm when the baby is sleeping. This movement is felt by the mother from about 20 weeks of the gestation or earlier. As the pregnancy advances, the water around the baby goes on diminishing and hence the movements of the baby are more perceived. You may please count the score of the movements. During 12 hours time if it is moving about 10 times, you do not have to worry. This is normal and is indicating a healthy active fetus. Any variation in the fetal movement count needs to be reported to the Obstetrician. I hope this helps you.',\n",

If you are having varicocele then you should be more worried about the decreased motility of sperms rather than the sperm count as varicocele leads to qualitative defect rather than quantitative defect, moreover you have sperm count of 25 million which is good enough for fertilization.I would recommend you to start cap.Evian and tab. Lycopene which are natural antioxidants, and they will improve the health of sperms, secondly I would advise you to get operated for your varicocele as varicocele cause States of blood in testis, and it increases the temperature within the testes which causes the sperms to die or deform ultimately causing reduced sperms' motility.\",\n",

First do not panic 2. As you have regular cycles, please get ovulation study on USG from day 10 of the cycle to know about the day of ovulation. 3. Post menstrual HSG - hysterosalpingography, within first ten days of the cycle will be helpful to know about the patency of fallopian tubes. 4. Please get husbands semen analysis done with abstinence of 3 to 5 days.  This helps to know about quality and quantity of sperms. 5. You can simply opt for unprotected sex act on and around the day of ovulation. 6, Lastly, about your concern of seminal fluid coming out of vagina.

Because lung surgery is considered as major surgery and heart lung bypass is needed during surgery. And chances of post-operative complications are very high at this age.

My condition is completely better but the med. is causing me to have a bad stomach and a dizzy feeling. Would it do any harm if I didn t take that last pill? Doctor: Hello,First bronchial asthma is not an infection. It is a condition in which there is spasm of bronchial muscles and air pipe which causes breathing difficulty. Whenever we start any antibiotic, the course should be completed even if you are feeling better before the course gets completed. The reason behind it is if you do not complete the course, the bacteria or infective agent develops resistant to the antibiotic which you didn't complete the course. And next time if you again get the infection by the same infective agent, the antibiotic won't work the next time, and you will need higher antibiotic.

I refused all of these, and took two herbs that stopped the symptoms in three weeks that I had for more than a year. Yes, I could die in a couple more years as they expected, but I would rather die than have surgery. Doctor: Hi, I am extremely sorry to know the condition. I want to assure you that prostate cancer is slowly progressive disease. The treatment depends on the stage. You have not mentioned any detail of investigation. Specially serum PSA, Gleason score, and invasion size and lymph node status to be mentioned. In early stage if life expectancy is more (like more than 10 years or 5 years depending on additional criteria) radical treatment is offered. As they have offered surgery or RT probably your disease is at early stage. Anyway if you do not want surgery then go for radiotherapy. Radiotherapy can be given Dy image guided technique and is non-invasive. Minimal toxicity is there. Adjuvant hormone therapy will be prescribed also. There is a good chance of total tumor control.

My foot is still swollen, but the troubling thing is that in the past 2 days I have gotten extremely light headed and felt like I was going to faint (this has never happened before). This has happened after long periods of walking/moving around. Could this be related to my ankle? Doctor: Hello, What I would say is this nowhere related to the fracture of the fibula.  Next thing I would like to know are you on any medications? If so please check this could be related to that. Also, what is your age? Are you on any High blood pressure medication? Are you diabetic? If the above one doesn't fit your category than this should be just having weakness of the body and nothing else. For swelling, I would advise you to keep the leg elevated over a pillow at most times because you have a cast applied and also there is very less mobility, so there will be an obvious chance of reduced venous return. Keeping the leg elevated helps more. Try having Lemon juice with added auger and pinch of salt for dizziness. Rest assured, you should do well.  Hope I have answered your query.

The red mark is slightly irritating though I think it might just be due to my own periodic self examinations. The surface around the bump is sometimes shiny as if moist. The seems no bigger then a nodule for a hair but I can see any hair coming from it and Im not sure if its an ingrown or not. Doctor: HelloThanks for query. Red patch with small bumps on glans penis after having protected sex is mostly due allergic reaction to chemicals in condom used as lubricant.

Kim Doctor: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Usually Klebsiella bacteria are pathogenic in the respiratory tract and urinary tract but not on the GIT or diarrhea. We can count these bacteria as a communal flora of the intestine and can ignore its presence in the stool. So in my opinion you should not take the Chat Doctor. Pathology for diarrhea may be something different and so can be diagnosed and treated accordingly.Maybe you have taken the long-lasting antibiotics that has washed of your communal flora. I advise you to take the probiotics like Lactobacillus spore. This help replaces the flora and can help in prevention of diarrhea. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/',\n",

The pain can occur for a day or two but if it is prolonged it could be a sign of infection. However in your case, you mentioned you wear retainers- that is one of the possible cause of pain. You are not supposed to wear retainers for at least two weeks till the gums over the implant heal well. Or if it is too important then your retainers must be lined by a \\\\\"soft tissue liners\\\\\" which will prevent any trauma to the underlying gums when you wear the retainer. it\\'s not a good idea to wear retainer in post surgical phase.

So i went back to draw blood and check with my doctor my CEA go back up to 26.     I would like to know am i do the right thing? just only change my diet and not listen what my doctor tell me what to do??? right now i feel just like normal person, i can go to exercise, running, walking, but i lot some weight  because i eat only fish, vegetable, and fruit.would you please, answer me what am i suppose to do??

His dairy intake is not excessive. He has a glass of milk in the morning or afternoon and occasionally pizza.

Both of them can cause rise in uric acid level (hyperglycemia). This high uric acid can accumulate in joints and cause joint pain. It can also cause fever with chills.

I can understand your concern. If connective disease is ruled out and since your CT chest are normal as told by you, no need to worry about lung infection.

I have been duding salt rinses, using listering and the rinse my dentist gave me without results.  Please help!! Doctor: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The bump on the gums could be because of gum infection secondary to chronic irritation by the denture. Consult an oral physician to rule out whether it is a gum infection or an over growth of the tissue. If it is infection you can take a course of antibiotics and analgesics.

I suggest you not to worry much. You have not given your age here. Please understand that sex is not essential for human being.

You are expecting your girlfriend to behave according to your wish and when she disagrees you are disappointed. What is wrong in that? How can you call yourself horny on that aspect?

Vitamin E, known for its healing qualities, helps nourish skin and fade scars. Open a vitamin E capsule and apply gel directly to the scars twice a day until you see them start to fade, then apply once a day thereafter. Eat foods rich in vitamin K. These are good for your skin because vitamin K helps heal and protect skin from wounds and scars. Slice a fresh lemon and brush across your chicken-pox scars. Coat chicken-pox scars liberally in honey once a day. Rub raw garlic on your chicken-pox scars at night. If your scars are new, rub sandalwood oil on them. Do this for a few months, and you just might prevent your scar from setting in the first place. If your scars are very old, rub coconut oil on them every morning. Hope this helps you.

But he is moving his hand and legs very well but still not started to crawl. When we make him stnd he keeps on jumping and climbing up. Is there any problem Doctor: No not at all. Crawling usually started on 3 -6 months of age. At 6 month babies are usually sitting on the floor without any support and around 10 months of age they try to stand and walk with some support. According to your history the baby shows appropriate developmental stage. So do not worry.

       "  \"Patient: I am a 32 year old woman having bulky uterus and endometrial thickness. I have been suffering in irregular and heavy menstruation for more than 15 years. I want to get relief from this.I have a 2.4 years old son, if I wish to conceive now, is there any problem?pls advice me . Doctor: Hi, Thanks for the query. Better to go for dilatation and curettage once with your doctors' advice. This helps for diagnostic purpose, to obtain the tissue for histopathological examination. And for therapeutic purpose. By doing D&C heavy bleeding can be decreased in next cycles. If the histopathological examination shows normal tissue, no need to worry. Once check for hormonal profile and thyroid profile. If you are having regular ovulation, there may not be any problem in getting pregnancy. Track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. If hormonal profile is somewhat abnormal, you may need support of hormones in the early pregnancy. Take care.\",\n",

Doctor: Hi, A follicular study shows the development of the egg in the follicle, and can indicate the size of the follicle and can identify when the follicle ruptures. It cannot say if fertilization has occurred or not. Have you taken ovulation induction as well? If you have been trying for 4 months only, I would advise you to wait for 1 year, as most couples(85%) conceive in a years time on their own. The remaining need to be evaluated for the cause and then treated. The most likely period to conceive is 36 hours after the follicle ruptures. Hope this helps. Regards.',\n",

Ive also taken hpts several times but they all come back negative. also I get like a tingling sensation around my belly button. could I be pregnant? Doctor: Hello dear, I understand your concern. The first sign of pregnancy is missed period. And to confirm a urine pregnancy test need to be done a week after missed period for accurate results. The symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period. The fetal movements start around 5 months of pregnancy. The chance of pregnancy appears less with your symptoms but confirmation need to be done by urine pregnancy test. If the test is negative there is no chance of pregnancy. So relax.

My last visit, I was advised to wear them only at night. I noticed significant change 2 weeks later after doing so. My teeth kept shifting. So I switched to wearing them all the time again. The shifting doesnt stop. Did I mess up? Doctor: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint Orthodontic Retainers are advised to maintain the changed teeth position after achieving proper alignment of teeth post completion of orthodontic treatment. But in case if the teeth movement has started occurring and not being controlled even after increasing the time duration of wearing retainers, there is a possibility that the retainer wires have become loose and not providing sufficient pressure over the teeth leading to relapse of the maligned teeth. I would therefore suggest you to consult your Orthodontist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and x-rays can help in diagnosis and treatment can be done accordingly. You might need a fixed orthodontic treatment followed by repeated wearing of the retainers. The orthodontist might also advise you removable orthodontic appliances for re-achievement of alignment. You should also not delay the treatment or else there can be complete relapse of misalignment and then treatment can take a long time. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

I had my appendix out few weeks ago ,but this is different feeling ,I m also waiting to be seen for a positive rnp test ,I dint know if this pain has something to do with my mixed connective tissue disease. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your problem and situation. In my opinion you are having mostly HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), but better to rule out cardiac cause first for your symptoms. So get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal then no need to worry much for cardiac cause. It seems HERD more. Gaseous distension is also seen on HERD, and this is giving you bloating feeling of abdomen. GERD is because of laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this the acid of the stomach, tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of dull aching, burning central chest pain. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid stress and anxiety.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3.

One of the recent 2 occasions was when masturbating so no great exertion was involved. My bloods indicate I am menopausal and I am only having periods about every 4 months currently. I am 53.

I cannot say in your particular case and the pain follows a particular pattern which implies where the pain is from.

Already you had been told that you have gum problems i.e., gingivitis and receding gums. These problems will not cause white spots on the gums, which are painless. Second thing and important thing in your query is you deal with a lot of stress daily. Because of that stress some kind of white spots which are pain less, may form not only on the gums but also on the entire mucosa of the oral cavity. I strongly suspect that white spots may be because of that stress. Anyhow you kindly visit the dentist one more time. If those spots are same what I suspected, then the treatment is required apart from stress relieving methods. I think my answer would satisfy your query.',\n",

       "  'Patient: I have a DVT factor 8, had this condition for 11 years. I have had pressure in my chest. I have a greenfeather filter. Today I went to the emergency room. They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary. I am 42 years of age female never smoked, been in great health. Now these items are coming up. I am scared these doctors are not finding what is wrong even with my condition. Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this? Doctor: Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems that the swelling of tongue that you have developed has nothing to do with the DVT and pressure in chest you are having. I agree with your doctor that it seems to be an allergic reaction. I would advise you to take Antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day for at least 5 days. If it was an allergic reaction, you should find immediate improvement in the swelling in 1-2 days. Otherwise, the cause is not allergic. The allergy could be due to anything that you have been exposed to through air, water or food. If the episodes are frequent, you should go for a blood test for allergy to find out what substance you are allergic to, and you can avoid exposure to that in the future. However, if the swelling does not decrease with the antihistamines or if it increases, then you should consult a dentist to examine the oral cavity and investigate further regarding the cause. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,',\n",

I have been suffering from this illment for almost 3 years. And eachtime i sneeze i see pint of blood when i spit. I hope you can have a solution to my problem. Doctor: Cellophane you for contacting Chat Doctor. Sneezing mostly occurs because of allergic response. As you have chronic allergy problem, so there must be some allergic element which triggers sneezing. If I were your treating doctor then I would have advised levocetirizine for it.

I would also suggest you to visit an allergist for detailed examination of what is the causative allergen, and then he will prescribe immunotherapy which will resolve it, hopefully. Thank You',\n",

Today I was changing and my ear got caught on my clothing and I pulled pretty hard. Now, its pussing clear liquid and is kind of throbbing and feels swollen and hot. Is it infected?

I ve had this pain for 2 days now and it comes and goes, I also have some tiredness and heartburn . What should I do regarding these symptoms? Doctor: Dear Leana, abdominal cramps are, unfortunately, a usual symptom during and before the periods.  Cramps are caused by prostaglandins which cause uterus contraction. The contracting muscles help push the blood out through a girls' vagina during her period. So these contractions can be mild or very unpleasant and can vary from month to month. Also, other hormonal disbalances due to menstruation cause nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue and abdominal swelling.  Girls who are younger when their periods start, who have longer periods or heavier blood flow and smoking are a risk factors for cramps. Heartburn can be related to this story, but also it can mean TAH you have some kind of gastric problems such as HERD, Ulcer/gastritis, so you should do gastrostomy to find the exactly what's going on. Use analgesics(nonsteroid) for pain relief because they decrease prostaglandin production in blood. To be sure that you're healthy do gynecology examination and pelvic ultrasound to check your uterus and ovaries and steroid hormone levels. Wish you good health,\",\n",

It seems like alergy to me which is common in Bangalore during this time. Last year my doctor prescribed Tab Montek LC (1 at Bed time for 3 days) and Tab Montek 10mg (1 at bedtime for 7 days). Along with this she also recommended Capsule Mucolite SR (three times a day for 3 days). And after three days, she asked me to continue the Montek LC for another 5 days. Unfortunately she is out of town now. Can I take the same medicine and dosage? Doctor: Hi there!I agree with you over the fact that allergy is common to Bangalore, however all attacks of cold/flu cannot be attributed to allergy. Morever indiscriminate use of anti allergic is not advisable. What I have seen in general is intensive steam inhalation using capsules of Karol plus along with tab ivory will bring you good relief. To confirm an allergic etiology to your cold you should check your serum IG e levels. If elevated they need to be monitored and specific antigen needs to be isolated for long term precautions and benefits.I would also recommend you getting yourself evaluated for chronic sinusitis as this also contributes to chronic cough and cold in many cases.

So first consult an Oral Physician and get the cause ruled out. Treatment of the same will help in relieving the oral symptoms too. For now symptoms can be managed with gargling with numbing mouthwash containing Lidocaine like Magic Mouthwash. Start taking vitamin B complex supplements daily.

       "  \"Patient: we were told our child may have abdominal migraines- both of this parents have regular migraines( headaches) and strong family history of headache migraines on both maternal and paternal sides.  One family member ( adult) has abdominal migraines.  Our child has what appears to be very strong episodes of nausea that can last for as long as six hours but usually around 1 to two hours.  nausea is in waves.  He gets extremely pale and says his cheeks feel numb and then sometimes his hands and arms do as well.. this can last as long as nausea sometimes.. I thought the tingling sensations might be panic related ( panics when the nausea is very bad) but GI doc said tingling should not last that long with panic.  He also has dark circles often with these and more recently has complained of back bothering him when he has these episodes.  He has had stomach cramping for two months now as well as the nausea but nausea is getting more severe... he had upper and lower scoping done and has been recently diagnosed with acid reflux for which he is taking 40 mg of prilosec in capsule form ( capsules poured out).  He has also been prescribed ondansetron for nausea ( which does not always seem real effective) also just started him on amitriptyline ( 10mg) just started last night.  had been hesitant to start him on the amitriptyline as the GI specialist said that with as severe and as long-lived as the nausea seemed, he wondered if it was maybe abdominal migraines and that the nausea would not be that long lasting with reflux alone.   So, my thought was if it was abdominal migraines, I wanted to monitor what he had eaten the days the nausea has been really bad.  The common thread I found for each day was caffeine and he loves iced  tea.  He has had six episodes of severe nausea, tingling etc in the last two weeks..... all lasting at least an hour if not more... He also urinates a lot and when he has these episodes and sometimes says he feels dizzy.  My main question is, if he continues to take the amitriptyline, is it then going to be difficult to diagnose him with abdominal migraines ( GI doc said if it is abdominal migraine, that is the med a Neurologist would prescribe).  Can reflux cause abdominal migraines or make them worse?    Looking back over the last couple months when this first started... he has been pale a lot ( looks sick)... we were pediatrician several times and were not to see specialist until next week but when he started losing weight specialist saw us sooner.  Son had difficulty eating at times the past couple of months due to feeling so nauseated and became thinner. and thinner.. trying to get him some relief he is absolutely miserable when he has these episodes.  Having nausea with headache migraines, I know how severe nausea can be... he does not cope with it well at all.  I take something at onset of headache migraines and feel good within a half hour... this is not happening for him...I really dont want him on meds for a long time but since migraines are so strong in our family, I am concerned this may be the case.  Do kids usually grow  out of these if it is abdominal migraine?  Could it be related to his hormones? He is 10 .  Concerned about side effects of med.... maybe things will subside when reflux clears up?  Thanks so much for any help you can provide!!!   Heartfelt thanks!! Doctor: With such presentations in my clinic, I would prescribe Comparison 1 tablet 3 times after 15 min before meals. It is gold standard for acid reflux.

Beauty is a perception... and It's not always external.... ! Dark color of your arms and legs could be due to harmful effects of Sun. First and foremost always apply sunscreen. The right method of application is that apply liberally, 10 - 15 min before stepping out into the sun and re apply after 2-3 hours. A broad spectrum sunscreen such as Uncross aqua gel will be good and non-sticky for a tropical climate. For lightening, you can try creams such as Bolivia but considering it is a large body part it is usually not continent to apply creams. You can opt for Chemical peels such as Glycol or TCA peels, for which your cosmetologist can guide you.

Based on your statement I would say that your husband has three prominent superficial veins on scrotal sac, These are dilated, prominent superficial veins over scrotal skin and nothing to be worried about it .

She went to sleep about 2 hours later me and my husband woke her up two times throughout the night. But today she is napping more and has diarrhea is this normal or what should I do? Doctor: Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Although the diarrhea is not related to the head injury, napping more in a child of this age is difficult to judge or rule out to be due to the injury. If I were your doctor, I would have advised you to keep a close watch on her level of consciousness to see if she is responding normally to your routine talks with her, and if she is moving her limbs normally, and has not got any vomiting. The bump on her head is due to collection of blood by the injury, and will subside gradually. In case of any change in the level of consciousness of hers to your commands, and any increase in the bump on the head, I would advise you to take her to the ER room of the nearest hospital, where they would examine her closely and if considered necessary might go for some investigations like a CT scan to rule out any concealed head injury. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

       "  \"Patient: My doctor gave me AcipHex for reflux. After about 4 days of taking it, my b/p has gotten down at times to 85/57. I know it s down because I start to feel cold, then check my b/p and confirm it s low. I bordered on high before. I m pretty sure I am having gall bladder problems due to the pain in my side, and it is better since I ve cut fat almost completely out of my diet. Is my gall bladder causing the low b/p, or the AcipHex? Doctor: Cipher (omeprazole) may cause hypotension. But it's usually associated with hypersensitivity reactions that includes symptoms like facial puffiness, difficulty in breathing and others. If these symptoms are absent, then It's highly unlikely that omeprazole could be causing hypotension. And regarding the gall bladder, not much information is mentioned so that we can comment on it.

       "  'Patient: 36 year old male. Hours after ejaculation I have brown particles in my urine. I have seen a urologist and had a CT scan and an x-ray and they found nothing, went back for a cystoctomy to scope the inside of my bladder and found nothing unusual. I did find out after the x-ray and CT scan that I only have one kidney; I never knew that. I have no abdominal or back pain, nor do I have pain during urination, I only know that something came out when I look into the toilet. I called my urologist after this happened again, I acquired a sample to bring in, they told me its probably a blood clot and not to worry about it and not to bring in the sample. I also have a hydrocele/vericocele on my right spermatic chord. Doctor: HelloThanks for query. Based on your statement that you have posted the brown particle that you have passed in urine hours after ejaculating is likely to be a blood clot mixed with urine which gets turned up into brown color. In the majority of cases this blood clots originates from a small superficial surface of prostate and gets sealed off itself immediately that causes a tiny blood clot to appear either in semen or urine passes after ejaculation. Since this is single episode and all the tests like C. T scan, X-ray and Cystoscopy did not reveal any pathological lesion you should not worry about it. If you have pain or discomfort due to Varicocele that you have on Rt side use scrotal support. This will prevent sagging of testicles and give relief from pain or discomfort. Chat Doctor.',\n",

Are there any difficulties in walking or tingling and numbness in both the legs? If yes then it also points towards canal stenosis.

Doctor: Hi, Leg cramps are a common and usually harmless condition where the muscles in your leg suddenly become tight and painful. It usually occurs in the calf muscles and in most cases there is no obvious cause of it If it happens sporadically then there is no need for any treatment or tests. But if this is common and affect your daily routine then some measures should be taken. In some cases, there may be predisposing conditions such can be seen in pregnancy, after exercise and certain types of medication, such as statins or in liver disease. The best way to manage this is to stretch your muscles regularly. In some cases, magnesium or calcium supplements may help Have enough fluids and avoid long sitting, regulate body mass.

Antibiotics sometimes mess with the normal good bacteria that exists in our intestines and cause diarrhea. You could take VINYL (lactic acid bacillus), one capsule 2 times a day.

Since I ve started the pill about 5 days ago, it s giving me bad nausea, even though I take it before bed. When I waleup I can t even move or I feel like I ll throw up. Will this side effect end? And if so, how long will it take to go away? I really hate being sick & there s no signs of my nausea going away Doctor: Hello Allie, I am Kathy - a nutritionist- and I may be able to help you with thisNausea is a common side effect with iron supplements. There are other iron supplements that are gentler on the stomach, and you may want to discuss this with your doctor. I am assuming you are on iron because your iron is low. You can increase your iron naturally by eating high iron foods such as raises, spinach, molasses and, if you eat meat, red meat is high in iron. Eating a source of high vitamin C along with your iron will increase the amount of iron you absorb, so fruit, vegetables are naturally high in C as is vitamin C enriched juices. Iron should always be taken with food. From what it sounds like, you are not eating with it. Try taking it in the am with food (but not dairy or high fiber foods) and include a source of vitamin C with your iron supplement. Food does decrease absorption, but if the iron is making you nauseous, eat and/or ask to be switched to a gentler form of iron. In summary, take iron in am with food low in fiber and a source of vitamin C. Check with your doctor about these problems and see if there is a gentler form of iron you can take. Increase your iron in your blood naturally by including high iron foods. High iron foods should be combined with a source of vitamin C. Have a Great Day!',\n",

There are many signs and symptoms of cancer depending on the organ involved. In your wife there is a bright spot in the pectoral region therefore for it to be a cancer it should have grown aggressively over last 6 months with or without development of pain and. Most cancer appears like a lump in the chest and will be fixed to the chest wall. If it is bright on PET scan then it is not confirmed to be a cancer and biopsy is to be done to confirm it. There are other acute and chronic inflammatory conditions which might cause bright area on PET scan. PET scan is a technique by which the glucose metabolism is studied. Cancer cells and non cancer inflammatory cells might be seen on PET scan. It is suggested that in a 3.4 cm area the doctor does a CT guided biopsy and then the diagnosis is confirmed.

I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. MRSA is the staphylococcus bacteria. It can cause variety of infection and symptoms. Headache is one of the symptoms of the disease. I advise you should continue your current treatment. You can in addition do culture and sensitivity from the organisms. MRSA has wide resistant pattern. So once we have sensitivity we can take the antibiotics accordingly. Please do not discontinue half treatment. As MRSA than never responds to half treated antibiotics. Once cured you have to clear the MRSA from the system. You can use mupirocin ointment to clear MRSA from the system. Apply it to the groin, umbilicus, nasal septum etc. After applications for a week you can do swab testing for MRSA from this area. If you are free from MRSA its good otherwise it requires another round of treatment until you are cured. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.

But if your situation does not improve, I would recommend consulting with your doctor for a physical check up, a brain CT scan and a complete blood count for anemia. Hope to have been helpful!

Thanks, YYYY@YYYY Doctor: Welcome to Chat Doctor After going through your query I concluded that your daughter got fracture of her toe nearly one month back. By now it is likely that her toes must have united. Now she needs exercises of toe and analgesic for pain relief. Vitamin B, vitamin C and calcium supplements will promote healing.

Herbsputum has changed from green tomyellow iver the past four days while on antibiotics.Is this cephalosporin appropriate to treat klebsiella?

She has not measured her temperature, but says she feels clammy.Thank you Doctor: Dear Friend. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. See, the sensitivity depends on the culture. If the klebsiella is sensitive to cephalosporins then Cefuroxime would help good. There is no need of adding doxycycline to her. In fact, if her fever responds well to this antibiotic, let her complete course for at least 7 days. Some doctors also prefer to give treatment for 14 days. If her fever doesn't responds then adding a quinolone like Levofloxacin would be an appropriate decision. This is my personal opinion for you based on available details.

Post surgery your wound healing process take some time with right nutrition, rest&vitamin supplements to encourage college formation it will be more quick.Whereas, smoking,retard wound healing through impairing tissue oxygenation. If the oxygen supply is effected you will have slow wound healing and may even cause bacterial growth as Nicotine causes blood flow to slow down by constricting the vessels.

Doctor: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Your mother has an advanced stage of breast cancer and needs treatment targeted to the cancer spread. In this situation, the cancer cells might be controlled by chemotherapy and radiation. Her sugar levels are high and this can cause additional health problems during her treatment. Swelling of limbs might be an emergency like deep vein thrombosis. You should urgently consult her doctors and get a D dimer blood test and lower limb Doppler scan done to know if there are any clots in the deep veins of legs. This is an emergency and must be considered first. If she does not have DVT then the swelling of leg might happen when there is extra fluid collection in the limbs and this takes place in the tissues below the skin and is also called subcutaneous edema. Such a situation might arise during cancer treatment and due to diabetes or reduced kidney or heart function and needs to be treated. Please do not worry.',\n",

Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your question and guide you through the problem. Your sister has an HE of 3.5gm/DL. The normal HE for her is 12gm/DL. Her anemia can be multifactorial, blood loss due to fibroid, nutritional, menstrual loss. HE of 3.5gm/DL is a very low hemoglobin. The body goes into a state of high output cardiac failure and blood is not able to deliver enough oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen is a basic requirement of the cells. Hypoxia leads to accumulation of acids in the blood and the patient feels tired and breathless. Hence, I would recommend your sister be transfused with a total of 3 to 4 packed cells to get the HE till 7gm/DL. She can then be treated for the cause. She can then be given hepatitis, intravenous iron and treated for fibroid if any. Current day transfusions are safe and the risk of acquiring diseases is minimal. Hence, you shouldn't worry about that, I hope this helps you out. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to write back to me. Yours sincerely, ChatDoctor.\",\n",

Btw im 18. Doctor: Hi and thank you for asking. Usually it is normal that during or after a panic attack the person might feel breathlessness. You explain that after you now have learned to sort of keep calm your breathing feels really limited. To rule out lungs problem you can do a blood count test, a chest X-ray and a Spirometry test.

       "  \"Patient: My son was hit in the head three years ago with a tree limb causing his first seizure. Now at age 38 he doesn t use but can his right hand. He just recently went to the doctor an they diagnosed him with having MS. However then sent him to a neurologist an he diagnosed him with Corticobasal ganglion degeneration I feel like he had a stroke an it went undiagnosed. Doctor: I read your question and I understand your concern. To be honest I am very puzzled by your story, especially the corticobasal ganglion degeneration (CBG) part. CBG typically presents around the age of 60. The youngest ever documented case has manifested at the age of 34 (I rechecked before answering just to be sure). So if your son had that disease at 38 with manifestations starting at 35, he would be an almost unique case in the history of the disease, I would be really careful in taking that diagnosis. As for the distinction between MS and stroke related to the head trauma it should generally be easy with an MRI if history and examination do not already make that distinction. Without knowing more about the signs and MRI report it's hard for me to say something more because these diseases can have many presentations. The seizure would direct more towards the head trauma rather than MS, as would the fact that the deficit has remained constant in time since the hit, without new signs, as you seem to suggest, but as I said MRI and more details are needed. I hope things work out for the best.\",\n",

But as you have got pregnant, be a little aware that after 8 months starting, you should be cautious of any pain in abdomen.  Visit a doctor immediately if pain is there.

Doctor: Hello, As I see the history it looks like the aging factor and also some infection in the body. Since he is having loose motions this is due to the heat in the body.

Its is causing a lot of pain. Doctor: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint the blister that has caused to you is due to pus formation below the root tips of the infected tooth which at times perforates the bone and appears as a blister below the soft tissues.

But the other day which this has happened a few times my left fore arm locked up while washing my hair it hurt and also was numb my concern is could this be a sign of a heart attack or stroke? Doctor: Hi dear, When a herniated disc occurs, it can release pressure on nearby spinal nerves and the spinal cord, causing unpleasant painful symptoms, very common ones are neck pain, radiating arm pain, shoulder pain, and numbness or tingling in the arm or hand. Pain by patients are general explained as dull, aching, and difficult to localize to sharp, burning, and easy to pinpoint. Pain in your arms as well as in your neck is usually the first sign that your nerve roots are irritated by a problem in your neck. Symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and especially weakness in the muscles of your arms, are warning signs that your problem may be more serious. Weakness in your arms is a definite sign that you should see a doctor about your neck pain. So i don't think it's a heart attack sign neither a stroke. Not all patients with herniated disc require surgery. Patient can find symptomatic relief through non-surgical therapies such as exercise, medication, physiotherapy. I will really advise you to meet your consulting doctor for further management and proper treatment.I may also feel from your questing that this problem has limited your life/daily work to some degree, I can give you my honest opinion that in my clinical practice I have seen attest 95 % patient getting relief from physiotherapy and conservative management.I hope you will carry on with the treatment .TAKE CARE.\",\n",

Doctor: Hi, As you said you suffer from psoriasis and that is worsened after treatment of lichen sclerosis. You also have doubt that daily bathing is responsible. I would like to say about few lines for psoriasis.... Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing and autoimmune disease. There may be scaly plaques on various parts of the body, scaly lesions on the scalp and sometimes joint pain may be there due to politic arthritis. Exact cause is not known. Genetic tendency, autoimmunitity, stress, Chat Doctor. .etc. may be responsible for precipitation and exacerbation of the disease. You did not say what treatment you took for lichen sclerosis. If your doctor has given oral steroids or steroid injections for lichen sclerosis.that would have worsened the psoriasis. I do not believe that daily bath is responsible. I usually recommend cap accretion 10 mg twice a day along with methotrexate 15 mg weekly in three decided doses 12 hourly. This may be taken for long time till good response. Blood tests may be done to monitor the treatment. Apply mild steroid cream or calcitriol point on the lesions. For scalp psoriasis, tar shampoo may be done. You may apply moisturizer to improve the skin texture. Avoid soap bath for few weeks. Avoid stress and worries as that might worsen psoriasis. I hope you got my answer. Thanks.',\n",

I am a working women and most of my work involve working on the computer.i have the pain the middle of the spine at around the spot where I was give an injection for my c section. Pls advise Doctor: Hi, I believe that a good physical workup should be performed to discover the most likely cause of the localized back pain. It seems that you've lost nearly all the weight you gained during the pregnancy, so mechanical causes of back pain are probably less likely.  Still a good examination to distinguish different types of back pain including the possibility of chronic pain following the c-section is worthwhile and can help identify even other causes of chronic low back.  Psychological stressors causing back, shoulder, and neck pain are very common and even physical stressors such as working on computers without proper back/neck support or not taking frequent enough breaks, or being tensed in the shoulders and arms while typing constantly can play into the picture.  In short, a number of potential causes can be in play.  A good physical examination by a good physician with proper imaging studies and other workup will do a lot of elucidate the root of your problem. Hope I have answered your query.

For continuous erection, there must be constant erotic/romantic thoughts, feelings, and sensations in your mind. If your mind is diverted to concern about erection, you will lose erection or have delayed or no erection. This failure causes you worried more during next time and again makes you focusing on your erection rather than enjoying erotic feelings. You may read Senate focus on internet. I suggest psychological counseling with psychiatrist. Wish you good health.',\n",

I have been feeling very depressed for ages, I forgot how long, all I know is that my depression is always somewhere, sometimes, I feel no emotion, empty, hopeless, angry, lonely, depressed, sad, isolated, grief, and very guilty for no reasons. Almost every single symtom for depression and major/severe despression fits me, except maybe one or two. I think this was caused from 8 months or more of loneliness and isolation at school, having no friends. I also have social phobia, an eating disorder, sleeping disorder, crossed-eyes, and more weird and strange diseases. D Doctor: Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor.

My period is 14 days away and I do not remember bumping into something but it might be a possibility that I did. I have no trouble using the toilet, and no pain unless I press against my lower abdomen. I hope you can help! Thanks Doctor: Hi, Thanks for the query. Pain in the abdomen can be due to various reasons. During the menstrual cycle, ovulation (release of eggs from ovary) takes place around 14 days prior to the start of menstrual periods. Occasionally some people feel pain in the abdomen during that time. Other than that, if you have any other symptoms relating to your bowel movements or urination, those also could be a cause. You can wait for 2-3 days to see if the pain is subsiding by itself. If it does not subside, then it is better to get examined by your family physician. You can also get an ultrasonography of the abdomen done to see if any abnormalities is happening there. Hope I have cleared your concern. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance to you. Thank you. Regards',\n",

You have visited an ENT specialist, a Neurologist and a Dentist; none of them have detected any cancer; hence cancer should be highly unlikely.

       "  'Patient: This is general question. what is laparoscopy? Why it is done? Any risks? Doctor: Laparoscopy is a surgery that uses a thin, lighted tube put through a cut in the belly to look at the abdominal organs or the female pelvic organ. Laparoscopy is used to find problems such as cysts, adhesions, fibroid and infection. Tissue samples can be taken for biopsy through the tube. In many cases laparoscopy can be done instead of laparotomy surgery that uses a larger incision in the belly. Laparoscopy can be less stressful and may have fewer problems and lower costs than laparotomy for minor surgeries. It can often be done without needing to stay overnight in the hospital. Laparoscopy is done to check for and possibly take out abnormal growths such as tumors in the belly or pelvis, check for and treat conditions such as endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease, find conditions that can make it hard for a woman to become pregnant, do a biopsy, to look whether cancer in another area of the body has spread to the belly, check for damage to internal organs, such as the spleen, after an injury or accident, do a tubal ligation, fix a hiatus hernia or an inguinal hernia, removal of organs, such as the uterus, spleen, gallbladder, ovaries and appendix. Partial removal of the colon can also can be done and also to find the cause of sudden or ongoing pelvic pain. Risks include bleeding from the incisions, infection and damage to an organ or blood vessel. This may cause more bleeding that needs another surgery to repair.',\n",

Cancer is a challenging condition but must be treated till the end. If your family member had a cancer near bladder mouth then she must have had locally infiltrate disease requiring exoneration. This is a surgical procedure by which most of the tumor and its adjacent structures are removed. Even after surgery, seeding of cancer cells might take place and has happened in her case. If there is recurrent growth of cancer then she must take combination treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. As you have mentioned that she is too weak for chemotherapy therefore focused radiation remains the most tolerable treatment at the moment, but this depends on the general condition and local recurrence of the disease.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has another component which is \\\\\"impulsivity\\\\\". Many boys who have attention deficit hyperactivity also have impulsive behavior.

       "  'Patient: Ive been getting knee pain for a while in the same leg that i had a tibial nail in some 7 years ago. My quad on that leg has never really come fully back to the size of the other leg. I have an office job, so I m relatively inactive during the day usually, but have had the last 2 weeks off as holiday and have been more active moving some furniture, fixing things around the house, some home improvement and a bit of gardening. This morning I woke IP with a round, painless bruise on my kneecap, near the top inner edge. My knee does grind a little at full extension, but that happens quite a lot anyway. Over the past week, the quad muscle on the affected side has grown and become more responsible, but is still smaller than the other side. The knee is reasonably painful during stress and occasionally hits a big bit of pain when extending under load. Doctor: Hello, You had mentioned the previous history of trauma at knee and nailing had been done before 7 yeras, so might be that may cause compression and irritation to joint tissue. To rule out we must go for X-ray. Another cause may be due to continuously repeated heavy work, your qua Chat Doctor.  You should walk regularly do cycling swimming running jogging, if the pain is subsiding it means your thigh muscles were weak, or else you need to take an x-ray for the knee joint.

Doctor: The headache and heaviness aggravated by studying can be due many reasons. Assuming that you are a student, it is unlikely that you have a refractory error (near vision problems are usually seen in middle age). Association with studies almost rules out other causes like sinusitis and migraine.  When mind is forced to do what it does not like, it will react in such a way that you have difficulty doing it.

Chest pain and coughing up mucus so went to the doctor who said i had pharyngitis. 2 weeks after and still coughing i developed really sore ribs especially when laughing, coughing, sneezing deep breathing and lying down in bed. Went to the doctor who said it was the intercostal muscles and gave me pain relief and an inhaler due to shortness of breath. 2 weeks later due to not breathing properly i developed a chest infection given anti biotics. After a month of pain relief and still not much relief she wondered whether the pain relief (diclofenac) was causing reflux making the cough worse so prescribed some tablets to go along with it.

I undergo Bronchoscopy also, but didnt show any problem then. But after these long years I am having on and off fever. Agin asked for Contrast CT. and the result shows that the nodule grew to size of 2.6 cm. and am asked for bronchoscopy again. The first result of bronchoscopy showed on reading like 18HU. is there any possibilty of malignancy. Or is there any risk with that nodule. Doctor: This is likely a growth of some sort, whether it is benign or malignant (cancer) can only be definitively determined on a biopsy. The fact that it has not grown much over 4 years makes it more likely to be benign, and would only require follow-up imaging. When there is enough concern for malignant tumors (for example if there is fast growth, or you have an extensive smoking history), the nodule would need to be surgically resected. If you are having other symptoms such as fevers and chills, then your doctor can evaluate you for an infectious granuloma being the cause of this nodule. TB (tuberculosis) or fungal infections of the lungs can do this. I hope this gives you some of the answers you were looking for.',\n",

Also, the mechanism of the injury may have helped us to understand the injury better. I will advise to hot water fermentation, do feet, toe and finger strengthening exercises which can be performed under the water and lastly to keep the limb elevated so the swelling reduces, and the venous return is improved which will help the healing process to occur faster. But please make a note to take an x-ray of the foot in the AP and lateral views. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.',\n",

All of yesterday I had horrible cramps, the blood was a bit darker than usual, and there was what looked like a piece of skin with the blood. This has never happened to me before, and I was wondering what it could be. Doctor: Hi. Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. The main mechanism by which a hormonal injection acts is through suppression of ovulation. An ovulatory cycle are painless and that's why your Chat Doctor.  Generally it takes some time for the hormones to act as they are administered externally, and the body takes some time to get adjusted to this hormonal imbalance. So, they may not be effective in preventing the ovulation in the very first month. If the ovulation has occurred already, then hormone injection will not prevent the fertilization but will certainly prevent the implantation. The tissue you saw could have been the expelled fertilized ovum. Also, heavy bleeding and delayed periods are common in the initial few months. If your period had been a little delayed following the hormone shot, then the tissue could be endometrium which is thickened when there is delayed period. If the bleeding persists and if you pass a lot of clots, then you should seek your treating\",\n",

Fam doc put me on steroyds,,, twive and came back each time. Cardiologist wanted me to take motrin or alege but I have colitis and it disrupts my system. Do you have any further insite you could share with me. Maybe I should get another oinion? I felt horrible last night and the room was spinning while my heart has twitching and hurting....did not know what to do, esp when I broke out into a bad sweat? I am tired of this. Doctor: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium with occasional pericardial effusion. About 90% of the causes are unknown. Most people will have viral type symptoms such as fever, myalgic, and malaise. Pericarditis can also cause cute, sharp, stabbing chest pain that can last hours to days. Some people will also get shortness of breath and pain with breathing. I am assuming you had a pretty extensive work up before being diagnosed with pericarditis. The work up should've included blood work with inflammatory markers and cardiac markers, as well as EKG changes. The first line treatment is usually ibuprofen several times daily for about two weeks. There are other anti-inflammatories that work just as good if you cannot tolerate ibuprofen. Steroids are actually a second line treatment but work just as good as ibuprofen. Generally, about 7 to 10 days of ibuprofen can significantly decrease your symptoms and pericarditis. You should also get plenty of rest.  Some people have will have recurrent pericarditis. You should also have an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there is no fluid around the heart. If you do not get better with ibuprofen in 10 days, I would recommend having a further work up to make sure you do not have my own pericarditis which involves the heart muscle.\",\n",

Benign breast lesions (such as cysts and fibrotic changes) usually occur when there are hormonal changes (i.e. before during menses, pregnancy, etc.). Breast ultrasound may be initially recommended.

I am confused as to if it is really necessary to have it removed or just to live with it. Doctor: Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Erythroplakia lesions are of more concern since they are considered precancerous. In your case the surgeon is probably doing the best way for you, as removal of the lesion will be the first step in it. Taking the whole growth is more advantageous, because if it turns out to be malignant, the doctor has already taken the first step in treatment by removing it. A pathological study of the specimen with determine whether it is precancerous or cancerous, such that it can be monitored better. Relax and go ahead with the procedure, though you can always take a second opinion from good surgeons. Hope this was helpful. Thanks and regards.',\n",

Doctor: Hello Your findings suggests mild fat deposition in liver(fatty liver) with enlarged prostate. Fatty liver is a reversible condition. Fatty liver can be managed by diet control and exercise in the majority of the cases.

You should avoid saturated fat and take plenty of fibers in diet. You should increase your physical activity and go for exercise regularly. Simple cyst in liver is age related developmental finding. It only need to follow up if it is asymptomatic. Mildly enlarged prostate need clinical correlation and further investigations.PSA(prostate specific antigen)should also be assessed in enlarged prostate.

I started my new pack of pills on time and everything was fine. Well on the 3rd week I messed up and skipped two pills. I had to restart a pack and now have been spotting for over a week. Help! Doctor: Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to tell you that the antibiotics you took in the first pack should not interfere with the birth control you took, and the fact that you got a normal period on time means you do not have to worry about pregnancy. Missing two or more pills in a row usually causes some breakthrough bleeding a few days after the missed pills, even if you make them up.  This is the bleeding you are experiencing now.  It most likely will stop eventually, but may continue until you finish this pack. You maximize the possibility of stopping the spotting by trying to take your pills at the same time every day.  A way you can help remember your daily pill is to take it at the same time as some routine activity you do every day, for example brushing your teeth, or having a morning coffee.  Carrying your pills in your purse all the time can also help if you do not consistently stay in the same place every night.

The doctors won\\'t insert it directly after birth - as the uterus still has to shrink back down to the normal size and any intrauterine device wouldn\\'t be\\\\\" held\\\\\" by the uterus. Most women won\\'t have sex during those 6-8 weeks - as you are still postpartum - having postpartum discharge which is first red and slowly turns a different color until it stops after about 6-8 weeks. You can usually talk to the doctor at your postnatal check-up - or just after the birth so that the insertion can be organized for you ahead of time.  Hope this has helped. Kind regards, JR',\n",

Then I invited him back to my apartment. He didn t make love to me he didn t kiss me, I saw his face, he made as effort not to get into it. I m really attractive so I knew something wasn t right. He admitted to me that he wanted to tear me to pieces when he first saw me because he wanted me so badly. It s been up and down. He wants me but he plays these strange sulky games. I m confused. Also he has had 2 dui s and a felony for breaking in to beat up his sister s boryfriend. He is highly intelligent, a student as the Uof I. But unable to connect emotionaly. He has grandious ideas about becoming a politician and says that is why our relationship must be a secret. I m 14 years older than him. I know something is wrong with him but I ve never come across this type of behavior. Doctor: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  To know more about him is the only way to find what is troubling him. I rather say that as he is intelligent (in your opinion) he is playing safe. You have the capacity to understand him. As he is an aspiring politician, as he says, he wants to keep himself away from affairs, which might trouble his future. That is a good opinion. At least he is focused towards his future. Things like flirting and having sex is not his concerns. He is much more matured than that. Understand him and adore him. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.',\n",
       "  'Patient: Ive been getting serious chest congestion that last up to 7 days too two weeks every now and then. About a year ago I got bad chest congestion that lasted up to two weeks. It got better and I went on with my daily tasks, about 4 months later I got terrible chest congestion again, I got better within two weeks again. So a year later I got chest congestion again, it lasted one week. About a month later (A few days ago) I got bad chest congestion again, it gets to the point where I cant walk Im so out of breath and Im worried that it might be more then just chest congestion, I do have severe allergies. And it gets bad sometimes when the mold is high. Im wondering do you think I might have COPD or any other serious condition?. Im young and I dont smoke. My family doesnt have a history of diseases so Im at a loss. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are having severe allergies, possibility of asthma or allergic bronchitis is more likely for your symptoms. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). N acetyl cysteine (NAC) is also beneficial to relieve congestion. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.',\n",

Sorry to take up your time I thought this was free..Can t afford 15.00..Thanks anyway Doctor: Hi your mothers condition is caused most probably by weak heart pumping action which leads to accumulation of fluid in the legs and feet. This part is below the heart and gravity contributes to this also. In addition, she may be having a partial block of the veins which take the blood away from the legs.  She sits a lot which is not good and should walk around and use elastic stockings which help this to some extent. Another important thing is a check-up by your doctor to see if the veins affected are the deep ones or those near the skin. Medication will be needed for this. Keep the legs elevated while sitting, and she may do ankle foot exercises to aid in pumping of the blood. You are most welcome and hope this is useful for your mother.

I had a radical prostatectomy and have subsequently been treated at MD Anderson with intermittant lupron and casodex. My present condition is extremely good and has been so since surgery. On my most recent restaging and evaluation (Sept 2012) the term malignant neoplasm of prostate was included as an alert notice. I did not read this note until just recently. I am wondering if this indicates a change in my diagnosis, or has this terminology been relevant from day one? Doctor: Hi, Your prostate cancer risk stratification should be mentioned. You should mention your baseline PSA value before treatment and staging based on pathology report. As your Gleason score was 10 most probably your disease was high risk prostate cancer. In this case adjuvant radiation may have some role (pelvic radiation). Anyway it is not clear whether radiotherapy was given or not. Now you have to check your PSA value at regular interval. As radical prostatectomy has been done then PSA value more than 0.2 NG/ml may indicate biochemical failure. Then your treatment can be changed. Another issue you have to know whether at any time your PSA value came below 0.03 NG/ml or not. This has got prognostic implication. Prostate cancer and malignant neoplasm of prostate are synonymous.

In your semen it is 20 million / ml and your semen is 2 ml, so in aggregate it is 40 millions means below normal. Normally if semen is taken after 3-4 days abstinence than its volume increases, so in that case it may be 3 ml than count will be normal. Motility is usually 90-100 % but in your semen it is 70% so they (sperms) are less motile than normal. Immobile 10 % and this is also normal (normal 10% immobile)20% are straight, and they are dead.  Rest of analysis is non-specific so no discussion. In my opinion consult a physician and get his opinion and treatment.

It could be a cyst, a fibrous (fibrous tissue formation) or fibrotic changes of the breast, which are all benign breast lesions. Malignancy must also be ruled-out.

That includes both hepatitis or cancer. I don't believe the elevations are related to the high TSH. You are in an age group where chronic hepatitis C is commonly diagnosed. Hepatitis C can cause such elevations without a lot of symptoms. If you were my patient, that is one of the first things I would check. At the same time, you could also be checked for other types of hepatitis. Other problems with your liver or problems with your gallbladder might also cause the elevations.

It does not mean that the birth control pill is not effective. On the contrary it is working very well. The lining of the womb has become so thin that there is nothing to shed. In other words the progestin has won out over the estrogen. Many women actually like this as a side effect of taking oral contraceptives.

       "  'Patient: Hi, my gf and i were fooling around and i ejeculated, there was some sperm on my hand, around 5 minutes after that we started fooling around again and without thinking i i introduced my hand in her vagina, I think she was in a really fertile moment since it happened 13 days after her menstruation, how possible is it that she may be pregnant? Doctor: HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern. Generally, fingering cannot result in a pregnancy. Also, pre ejaculatory fluid can lead to pregnancy at times, however you have not mentioned if any penetrative vaginal sex occurred. Sperm cannot survive outside in the hostile environment for 5 minutes, according to me, the chances of a pregnancy resulting from the encounter described are next to nil. If there was no vaginal penetration, then pregnancy cannot occur. However, if you are very concerned, you can still ask her to take ECP (emergency contraceptive pill) as a precautionary measure. When taken within 120 hours of unprotected sex, it is more than 80 % effective in guarding against a pregnancy. The expected period can be advanced or postponed for almost a week, after taking the Echo there is no way to predict the next date of her period. To be on the safer side, if you think there was some chance of a pregnancy please take a pregnancy test 4 weeks after the episode occurred. All the betake care.',\n",

He was recently diagnosed with Parkinson s disease with a chance of dementia. They did an MRI on Monday. It says Minimal Involutional Changes Appear Chronic. He is also very moody and saying hateful and hurtful things. He has always been difficult to deal with but he is getting really bad. My first thought was Alzheimer s. Any suggestions? Doctor: Hi, Regarding your concern, I would explain that his symptoms seem to be related to depression. From the other hand cognitive changes are common complications during Parkinson disease. They are related to the degradation of the brain cells, related to the disease itself. Besides, mood changes can also be related to Parkinson therapy. Anyway, I would recommend consulting with his neurologist and performing some cognitive tests in order to determine properly his cognitive problems. A psychiatric evaluation is also necessary to exclude possible depression, which can interfere with his memory and attention. There are different treatment options which can help improve his mood changes and his memory. Hope to have been helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Kind regards,',\n",

I have been rotating tylenol and motrin every 4 to 6 hours but her temps are really high.105.8 was her last temp taking on her forehead and 107.0 under her arm. I use a digital temporal thermometer would that be accurate and should I take her to the ER? Doctor: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\\\\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\\\\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.

My doctor said, I will not get pregnant because of this situation and suggested some medication for 3 months. and also said if I wont conceive in these 3 months, she needs to do some tube test. I am really scared that I will never get pregnant. I desperately want a baby. Can you share your thoughts on the above? Thanks Doctor: Hello premenstrual blood PCR positive for mycobacterium suggests endometrial tuberculosis. In the woman, it causes tuberculous enteritis (infection of the uterus) and salpingitis (infection of the tubes). This infection can often be silent, and may not cause any symptoms or signs. Once the histologic diagnosis of TB endometriosis has been made(like in your case), then treatment with antitubercular medicine must be started to prevent further progression of the disease. However, usually with TB endometriosis, infection of the fallopian tubes also occurs, and the damage caused to the tubes (TB salpingitis) is irreversible. Infection of tubes might result in irreversible tubal infertility, and the only treatment option available then to conceive would be IVF. In the past some doctors would try to do surgery to repair the tubes, but this is futile surgery, because the tubes never work properly once they have been infected. Tubes which have been severely damaged may form a HY Chat Doctor. Although antitubercular chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, surgery may be indicated where medical therapy has failed to resolve symptoms and in presence of a persistent pelvic mass.

Hysterectomy may be done for both uterine cancer and cervix cancer (total hysterectomy with bilateral ovary and tube removal). The problem you have mentioned probably is a post-operative complication. During operation gut handling may be the cause. As you have not mentioned on what post-operative day the problem started detail explanation is a bit difficult but regular electrolyte monitoring preferably at 24 hr interval and conservative management is the best option.

If it is secondary to gallstones and your symptoms are occurring frequently and increasing in severity, it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. What you have is chronic cholecystitis, probably secondary to cholelithiasis (gallstones). The most important thing to take note here is that an elective or scheduled cholecystectomy has better post-operative outcomes and less risk of developing complications as compared to the one done emergently. Diagnostics (such as ultrasound, liver function tests, blood count, etc.) and management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Definitive treatment for gallstones is cholecystectomy or surgical removal of the gallbladder along with the stones. It can be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique. Low fat diet is also recommended. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.',\n",

Not getting pregnant within two months of regular contact is not a big thing to be worried. If you are not able to conceive even after 6 months of regular contact then you need to go for investigations.  It is possible to have occasional ovulatory cycles in spite of you having regular periods. The frequency of sex during these two months also matters. Ultrasound examination for follicular study during the expected ovulatory period will reveal the presence of ovulation. Other factors like tubal block, cervical factors, Congenital anomalies, hormonal factors and immunological factors are to be investigated to find out the causes for infertility if you have not conceived even after 6 months.

Doctor: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Thank you for your query. A Hemoglobin level of 5, indicates anemia. The Ferro-f-tab has been prescribed to correct this. But in clinical practice a hemoglobin level of 5 would require blood transfusion for proper correction. Iron tablets do help, but usually take a long period of time and are mostly prescribed when there is border-line anemia. I suggest you discuss the possibility of a blood transfusion with your medical care provider. I hope I have succeeded in answering your questions, you could write back to us anytime for further clarifications. Best wishes.',\n",

Your food is healthy, and you are doing regular exercise that's a good thing. In my opinion get in ultrasound of liver with M R I so that exact reason of elevation of A L T (SGPT) can be found out.

Howard Watt Doctor: Hello, More and exact information about the status of mitral repair and the right heart will be available as we get a 2 D echocardiography done. The cause of the same depends on the reason why mitral valve repair was done. Generally the possibilities are 1) Higher lung pressure causing right valve leak, dilatation or decreased pumping 2) The repair has lived its time as its 7 years, and the disease might have progressed 3) Any new mitral disease 4) In previous era, tricuspid valve was not repaired even if it had moderate to severe disease considering its self healed after mitral repair.

About 5 yrs ago i remained without sex for about 20 days as i was abroad and on return one night after intercourse my wife discovered blood particles in my semen. Next day i visited my doctor and he had got all the clinical as well as pathological examination done, i also visited a urologist and after discussing my reports jointly they came to the conslusion that there in notinh serious and i was adviced to increase my sexual activities for some days and have to observe regularly about the presence of blood. Surprisingly the quantity of blood got reduced with each intercourse and after about one week it was clear. I was advised to remain sexually active or you can say not to put a big gap i.e. 10-15 days, if it happens i have been advised masturbation. After 5 years it happened again under the same circumstances. Is it a signal of a serious problem or is it a normal thing. Pl advise.RA Doctor: HelloThanks for query. You had blood in semen (Hematospermia) during sexual intercourse following abstinence for 3 weeks and was investigated thoroughly to detect the cause for same which turned out to be inconclusive, Normally during long period of abstinence there is stagnation of semen and sperms in reproductive organs (Epididymis, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory ducts etc.) resulting into congestion of these organs. Sudden release of pressure and congestion of these organs during first intercourse after incontinence causes what is called as rebound bleeding giving rise to Hematospermia.There's nothing to be worried about it. It is a normal phenomenon. Practice regular sex at least thrice a week to avoid such situation to recur again.  Chat Doctor.\",\n",

Should I get a MRI? Doctor: Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As after your history, I will advise to undergo an MRI of the cervical spine as the status of the soft tissue is must. Massage is strongly not recommended as you are doing all mixed up stuffs. Doing strengthening also and massage also will only make the muscle weaker. Also, just by mere working behind the blindfold treatment, I will advise to first take the MRI, and based on that, the combination of medication and physical therapy will work better. The physical therapist you choose, should know there is a difference between the patient to patient and symptoms to symptoms. A specialized plan for you should make a difference. Applying a conventional way of therapy will surely not function to the optimum. As, in my clinical practice I have seen cases with 100% recovery, but prior to that, the MRI, and the or tho prescription is understood for the pharmacokinetics of the Chat Doctor.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that this feeling looks like a paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmia (an episode of atrial fibrillation or flutter, frequent ectopic beats or even ventricular arrhythmia, etc.). There is only one way to confirm any possible arrhythmic events, by means of ECG registering during such unpleasant feelings. The most appropriate option would be to undergo an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring (Holder test). In addition, I would recommend you to perform a medical check up by your internist or cardiologist, for a comprehensive physical exam, a resting ECG, chest X-ray study, some additional lab tests like complete blood count, PCR, Thyroid, liver, renal function tests, blood electrolytes, etc., to rule in/out any possible flu complications, like thyroiditis, pericarditis, myocarditis, etc. that may lead to generation of cardiac arrhythmias and altered overall health status.

Lymph node enlargement cane seen in both viral and bacterial infections. Low grade fever with more nasal congestion and other symptoms are suggestive of a viral infection. something like infectious mononucleosis. You have a contact history also.(your son) Strep infection would have high fever with other symptoms but less nasal congestion. Also, your throat will have white plaques or pustules.

       "  'Patient: I have been experiencing a clavicular fullness, neck fullness and jaw pain for the past few years ..been tested for everything (nothing lfe threatening).. all they found was an abnormality in my submandibular gland (cystic) and a ranula. In past few months under my tongue is swollen and VERY painful (pain radiates to jaw) the swelling (mouth floor and clavicular)and pain come and go and I cannot tolerate the pain and numbness /Tingling anymore, nasty taste after swelling goes down... after reading a lot ... how do the drs distinguish if it is a ranula or a plunging ranula? Should I be worried? Doctor: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The swelling below the tongue can be a cystic lesion arising from the sub lingual salivary gland which is called manual. If this manual permeates through the mylohyoid muscle and spreads down to neck region and produces swelling in the neck region below the mandible, it is called a plunging manual. Consult an oral physician and get it ruled out, because infection arising from the teeth can also result in pain and swelling of similar kind. Get an ultrasound done to rule out the pathology. If it is diagnosed as manual or plunging manual, then it has to treated surgical to prevent complications like difficulty in swallowing, respiratory problems. The nasty taste can be because of the contents of the cyst which gets burst following any trauma to the cyst. I hope my answer will help you, take care.',\n",

       "  'Patient: Hi, i am on the Contreceptive pill but forgot to take one, carried on as normal and then had an upset stomach a week later, and carried on taking my pill for another 3 days until my pill free week. i didnt have another pack to carry on with and didnt expect having sex any time soon. i ended up having sex but used a condom which later had spilt. after 28 hours i went for the morning after pill. now i am due on my period and i am 2 days late. im reallly worried that i am pregnant. Doctor: Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.  So, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. Many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case.  If it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so I would repeat it in a week if that is the case. In addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. If you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks.  You should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,',\n",

CBT offering some help, the others, EMDR & Talk Therapy very little. The only relief I get is with 1MG Lorazepam as needed with no side effects. Why all the negativity re this medication. Doctor: Hi. I understand your situation. Keeping myself in your shoes and with previous experiences with these therapies in cases of anxiety and depression with aggravation SSRI, I would suggest either NLP or sunk six I acupuncture. NLP practitioner are available all over the globe. If you do not have access to any practitioner than you can read the best books I came across this topic - unlimited power and awaken the giant within. Both by Anthony Robbins. These are life-changing books and I highly recommend them from personal as well as patient experience. Six I acupuncture is different from Chinese acupuncture. It utilises very small needles with very small insertion depth only on palms. For emotional issues six I acupuncture is one of the best techniques to change the whole Constitution of the person. If am not sure which country you belong, but there are sunk association from Moscow who can probably guide you don't practitioner in your area. Hope this helps. Good luck\",\n",

It feels like something s being jiggled out of place and the pain is a sharp twinge. It started as a normal stomachache then moved to my right side. Doctor: Hello, As the location of the pain isn't mentioned it is difficult to put a comment which is directed towards the pathology. As you mentioned the stomachache and pain moved, I suspect it to be the higher side of the lower back where you are getting pain. This can be due to organs compression over the muscular system.

I am scheduled to have eight teeth and toris removed this wednesday.  Do you see a problem having the oral surgery done? Doctor: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. In acid reflux the teeth will get damaged secondary to the acid attack on the teeth resulting in erosion of the teeth. If sufficient tooth structure is there, then we can save the teeth by doing RCT. If the tooth structure is not there then it has to be removed. The teeth can be removed and Tori can also be removed but the antibiotics and analgesics should be of lower dose since this will cause gastric irritation and may cause vomiting and heart burn or gastric pain. Even the painkillers prescribed after the surgical procedure can worsen the acid reflux. So be careful and take precautions like antacids at regular intervals before the medications prescribed after surgery. I hope my answer will help you, take care.',\n",

Doctor: Hello, Your surgery is still considered recent, and you are in an initial healing stage. It is not uncommon for you to experience some discomfort. Take anti-inflammatory medication and finish all medication as prescribed. Report your condition to your treating dentist. This is the best recommendation for evaluation post surgery. Upper extractions and surgery raise some concern if there is a sinus complication during the healing process. Do you experience any congestion in your sinus area?  This can explain a pressure headache. It is not unusual to experience a pressure sensation with a large amount of inflammation after multiple dental procedures. Again, anti-inflammatory medication may help you deal with this discomfort and your discomfort should continue to decrease with time. There is greater concern if you feel this condition is worsening.

Noted your history and understood the concerns. You have already seen the urologist and undergone all the necessary tests, prostate, X-rays, ultrasound yet the diagnosis was unsure. So the Urologist gave you a long courses of antibiotics, but the pain is here again 7 on a scale of 10.

If there is a doubt, there is always a chance to take a second opinion of another Urologist or a senior General Surgeon. Scrotal support to elevate off the weight is also needed.',\n",

       "  'Patient: Hi. I had a housemate who had this grotty blistery thing all over his feet, which I seem to have caught. I had hoped that when he moved out it would have cleared up, which is not the case. Between the toes, and on the side of my foot Ive had several outbreaks, and when the blisters burst it seems to spread. The blisters and sites in general are very itchy. In the last week I had a large one of these blisters develop on the bottom of my foot, and when it burst it has become quite painful and red and seems to be infected. The skin around this area is also very itchy and is painful to walk on. In the last two weeks I have been working in a very dirty workshop, which would include exposure to dust, dirt and chemicals, and since my work boots are old and full of holes it is more than possible that some of this stuff has gotten into my shoes and to the infected site.Now, Im planning on going to the free university doctor on Monday, because as a student I cant afford to go to one of the emergency weekend docs, so I would like to know if there is anything I can do to reduce swelling or fight infection in the meantime.Thanks muchly Doctor: Hi there, As you have rightly concluded, we need to deal with the wound infection first, and deal with the blisters later when your university doctor can have a look at it.  What I would recommend right now is some anti-inflammatory tablets like diclofenac or even ibuprofen to help deal with the swelling and pain on walking.  For the infection itself, if you could get your hands on some antibiotic cream like mupirocin or acidic acid it would be useful to apply it twice a day to help control the infection.  If you are not able to get the antibiotic cream, find yourself some antiseptic cream with chlorhexidine or iodine to just help kill off whatever surface bacteria is there.  Try to clean the wound twice a day with some antiseptic solution to just get rid of any discharge and bacteria that is collecting on the surface.  Keep it as Chat Doctor. Your university doctor would reassess it on Monday and be able to prescribe you oral antibiotics if needed, and further treatment for the blisters itself. Hope this helps.',\n",

Young boy missing the school due to pain in abdomen on the right more in the middle of abdomen. Constant feeling of sickness. The CT scan and ultrasonography are not normal as there are few enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen at the same site. The gall bladder must be normal and removing the gall bladder without any evidence of inflammation or stone is no reason to remove it for a school going child.

Get the relevant tests of blood, urine and stool, Tidal for Typhoid, Quantifier gold test for Tuberculosis, Ultrasonography guided FNAC ID the nodes are just bellowed the anterior abdominal wall.

SS Doctor: Hello SST hanks for writing to us with your health query. You should have testing of ovarian reserve. This is tested by measurement of a hormone called AMH (anti Mullein Hormone). It is also measured by AFC (astral follicular count) - counting number of astral follicles on ultrasound on day 2 of your cycle. Also, your capacity to produce good quality eggs can be judged easily by your response to the stimulation injections given for GUI and IVF. If your doctors have opined that your ovarian reserve is poor, you have to accept that. Supplements like DHEA might slightly improve this, but it is not proven conclusively. Yes, the answer for you is egg donation / adoption. Of course, the alternative is following your heart and going for more costly attempts at IVF knowing fully well that the odds are in favor of failure, not success. Hard as it is to arrive to terms with this, the earlier you do, the better. Take care.',\n",

Should I take this to the emergency room or wait to see my dentist again? Doctor: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your query abscess over a broken tooth is due to deep infection in the tooth that is leading to pus formation below the root tips of the tooth. At times infection perforates the bone and the pus gets accumulated in soft tissues leading to lump formation over the gums and swelling of cheek. I would suggest you to consult an Oral Physician and not emergency room and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations like x-ray has to be done. You can be advised Root Canal treatment of tooth followed by a course of antibiotics and painkillers if tooth is in condition to be saved. In case of gross damage to tooth extraction is advised. As of now do warm saline gargles bit do not delay the treatment to prevent spread of infection and further complications. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.',\n",

Doctor: Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Firstly, I would like to suggest that you confirm where from this blood is coming, from the urethra or from the vagina. If it is from the urethra and if this is a fresh bleeding, it is likely to be from the urethral lining, mostly due to some infection. This needs to be treated as it can lead to a miscarriage if left untreated. If the blood is coming out of the vagina, you should inform your health care provider immediately, take absolute bed rest and avoid all strenuous activity. A sonogram should be taken to note the state of the pregnancy. Further management is accordingly planned. Hope this helps.',\n",

Doctor: Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that these blood pressure values are high, but a single high blood pressure value is not an indicator or chronic arterial hypertension.  It could be related to psychological stress or physical activity.  For this reason, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure values frequently during the day, in the next days, in sitting position, after 10 minutes of total relax. If your blood pressure values are above the normal ranges (125/85 mmHg), I would recommend consulting with your attending physician and performing some tests to investigate the possible underlying causes',\n",

After a two week period of antibiotics was able to come back to the states and saw my dr who after doing some lab work diagnose me with Mono.

Could the original diagnose of mono had been incorrect and all along i had salmonella? Doctor: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query. Yes, it is possible, but mono is more likely since there was throat infection associated with elevated LFT. Salmonella rarely cause LFT elevation unless there was blood poisoning.

Your doctor, before coming to his conclusion, that the problem could be exercise induced asthma, must have gone through ritualistic physical and pathological investigations.

Doctor: Hi there,Bleeding or spotting in early pregnancy, may mean a threatened abortion or an ectopic pregnancy. Both these conditions require continuous monitoring and treatment, which is why they are asking you to go back to the hospital for further evaluation. Repeated blood tests and ultrasound are required to know the location and normalcy of the pregnancy. If it is a threatened abortion, there is a high chance of the pregnancy continuing normally, but the first 12 weeks will be difficult. In case of ectopic pregnancy either medical or surgical treatment is definitely required. If your wife is having dizziness then it should not be ignored, and you need to see the doctor as advised.

Doctor: Hello dear, The size of penis is genetically determined, and it does not increase after a certain limit. But one thing should be known that the size of penis does not determine the potency of an individual. So, stop worrying about this. Also do not get influenced by any over the counter medication which claim to increase the size of penis or improve performance...it may be harmful. Having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts & honey increase blood flow to penis & maintains erection. Avoid stress...practice meditation.this helps in improving concentration & builds up the confidence level. Avoid smoking & alcohol. You can also do oil massage of the penis...it increases blood flow & maintains the erection. Wishing you a Healthy Life. Take care.',\n",

Doctor: Hi,first consult an ENT specialist and get your oropharynx examined for inflammation of your pharyngeal tonsils which is a common cause of recurrent middle ear congestion and ear ache, it can also cause rhinitis and breathing problems. You should also go for X-ray of paranasal sinuses for detection of chronic sinusitis, polypoid or any other pathology. If you are sensitive to cold and environmental pollution then avoid exposure as much as possible, you can go for complete panel allergen test and subsequent desensitization if possible, you should also go for total and differential count of WBC for eosinophilic and its subsequent management.

Thanks Doctor: Hello, I have gone through your query and understood the concern. It is true that the initial couple of cycles after hormone contraception need additional protection as they are not completely protected. Yet, as you have taken the emergency pill soon after the unprotected intercourse, you are safe. The high hormone content in the emergency pill creates hormone imbalances.

I should have taken the first pill of the new pack last night (Monday night) but forgot and took it first thing this morning (Tuesday).  I had sex with my husband last night.  Should I take an emergency contraceptive? Doctor: Hallow Dear, You have started the next pack of contraceptive pills in time. 12 hours delay once in a while during the cycle is permissible. Moreover, this delay was just at the start of the menstrual cycle. At this time, for practical purposes, no egg is released by the ovaries for fertilization. The egg is released 14 days prior to the next cycle when you are not on any contraceptive pill. While on contraceptive pill, there is no egg release. The released egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, period of about a week around ovulation is considered as fertile period. However, since you are on contraceptive pills, even that possibility does not exist. Dear Madam, you are well protected against the pregnancy. You need not take emergency contraceptive pills after this incidence of unprotected sex; because basically it is not an unprotected sex - you are well protected.

I consulted a specialist last year, and was told it is an allergy and would be trated over the period of time. For the last few days, the shortness of breath is severe and can not sleep also because of this. I am also having pain in right lower chest when deep breathing. I stay in a very humid place in the world (singapore) and one thing i have noticed that on a very humid day, this problem turns back with nausea as well. I consulted a doc few days back (General Physician) and he gave me some tablets (allergy and to clear the air ways). It worked for 2 days. The problem turned back again after a day. (Its raining again !!) what are the possible causes of this problem? Is there anything to be worried.what tests do you suggest me? Appreciate your help ! Thanks Doc, JayD Doctor: Hello Mr Jay. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I guess you have quit smoking for last 5 months, and if I am correct, congratulations on that. It is a very important step for your respiratory complaints. From your history, I would conclude that you are having recurrent breathlessness, worsening on humid days. You may be having allergy to house dust mite or molds, which increase in concentration during humid days or pollen which are released during rainy season. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will take your detailed history and suggest allergy testing. He may suggest you allergen immunotherapy after allergy testing. If you have frequent shortness of breath, you may need daily controller medications (inhaled corticosteroids, montelukast, etc.)I would also suggest spirometry with reversibility testing. This test is helpful to differentiate between asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  Apart from these, ensuring proper sunlight & ventilation in your rooms, avoidance of smoke-dust-air pollutants and regular breathing exercises will help you on a long run. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.',\n",

It is possible that the benign tumors you have mentioned are probably lipomas or neurofibromas. Both these tumors are soft tissue origin and not likely to become malignant if left untreated. A lipoma is a benign fat containing tumor which slips over the skin. A neurofibroma has nerve tissues and also does not change over time.

       "  'Patient: I m an obese male. Would stretch marks on my chest hurt? Medically I m okay aside from the need to lose weight, but I will get chest pains, but I can pin point them to where the stretch marks on my chest are. So do stretch marks hurt? And how can I stop it? Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, stretch marks can cause superficial pain at the site of Mark. But better to first rule out cardiac cause for your chest pain as you are obese. Obese patients tend to have higher cholesterol level. And possibility of Coronary artery obstruction due to cholesterol deposition in coronary arteries is high. And this can cause chest pain. So better to get done ECG and 2d echo first. If both are normal than no need to worry much for heart diseases. Weight loss should be done as soon as possible. And excess fat tissue can cause inflammatory reaction at the site of stretch marks. So first rule out cardiac cause and start weight reduction. Once you lose weight, inflammation will decrease and pain will also decrease. At present, you can take simple painkiller and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.',\n",

Low hdl and high ldl . My eating habits are horrible to say the least. Everything came back fine on my blood work except the cholesterol and my liver enzimes. My ast was 44 and my alt is 95. I was a super heavy smoker for about 2 years but quit about 3 weeks before my check up. I was told it could be fatty liver but I read it could be cancer. I lose sleep every night and worry myself sick. Im scared its liver cancer. Im scheduled for a liver ultrasound tomorrow. My question is do you think it will be liver cancer and are ultrasounds accurate or could they miss something. Thank you for your time and expertise. Doctor: Hi, high cholesterol is not a risk factor for liver cancer. Many liver lesions or body changes could cause an increase in the levels of AST and ALT. A cause is usually sought to know exactly what causes this increase. Its worthwhile doing tests to for viral hepatitis, especially Hepatitis B and C which normally should be excluded in such cases. The increase in the liver enzyme levels in your case is not that alarming, and confronting these results with other results are required for any appropriate interpretation and adequate concluding clinical judgements could be made. A liver ultrasound shall give an idea about the structure of the liver and any possible nodules, cysts or collections. It orients the clinical to make a suspicion. Definitive diagnosis of liver cancer is usually based only on histologic/biopsy studies. However, specific blood markers could also help. I believe you should be patient for the results of the liver ultrasound. However, main risk factors for liver cancer are excessive intake of alcohol, liver hepatitis viruses (B and C), Chat Doctor.  Excessive smoking is instead a major risk factor in lung, esophageal and to a smaller extent, gastric cancer. Meeting a gastroenterologist AFER your ultrasound in case you are still very worried is a reasonable option.',\n",

Leukemias are characterized by very high WBC levels (over 50,000/ cubic mm). However, the WBC count can be lower in case of leukemia. They are called sub-leukemic leukemia. In infections, the WBC count is also increased. An increase in lymphocytes (as in your case) can raise the WBC count. Lymphocytes are increased in chronic infections. H. pylori infection can lead to lymphocytes since it is a chronic infection. Treatment of H. pylori infection will clear away the lymphocytes and raised WBC count. Get the differential white blood cell count (DLC) in your mothers case. The DLC helps to determine the cause of infection. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.',\n",

If you had done the scan around your ovulation time, the fluid represents rupture of your follicle(egg), so there is nothing to worry. In case if the fluid persists throughout your cycle then I would suggest a complete check-up of your blood and hormones. But since you have been married for a year and with mild PCs, keep your monthly calendar on check, marking your ovulation (since PCs patient even mild, tend to ovulate at different times) and your post-ovulation till your menstruation time should be around 15-18 days.

It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. Breast cysts should be monitored regularly. Some of these lesions, grow, spontaneously resolved, and some are just there. Do you have a history of breast cancer or concerns in your family? Breast ultrasound will be requested as an additional tool for evaluation. Depending on the findings, if a tissue diagnosis will be recommended or just a regular follow-up/monitoring will do. Occasional breast pain/tenderness/discomfort, resolving spontaneously, is usually associated with these breast cysts especially during hormonal changes (such as before and during menstruation).

Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Regarding your concern, I would explain that hemophilia is not relate to heart attacks (which are thrombotic events) but to repeated episodes of hemorrhage. This disorder affects coagulation factors, resulting in an imbalance of coagulation, leading to spontaneous hemorrhages in all the parts for the body. Some studies have suggested that hemophilia is a protecting factor against coronary artery disease, but many studies have concluded that hemophilia patients have the same cardio vascular risk as other healthy persons. So there is nothing to worry about a heart attack at your age. Your symptoms may be related to anxiety. But I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, to exclude other possible complications of hemophilia (internal hemorrhage or brain hemorrhage). Further tests may need to be performed if suspicions are raised. Hope to have been of help! Best wishes,',\n",

My period is always usually 23 days apart. now i am 2 days late on my period. and the day i was supposed to get my period i had this light headache. how likely is it that i am pregnant? is it too soon to take a pregnancy test? Doctor: Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion the chance of pregnancy according to your explanation is rare. Nothing to worry. Consider doing a urine pregnancy test a week after missed period for accurate results. The symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination start usually 2 weeks after missed period i.e. around 6 weeks. The headache might not suggest pregnancy. So relax. Stress regarding the thought of pregnancy also delays the period. So wait and check for the period. Best regards...',\n",

Can a enlarged heart be made normal thru diet and exersice ? if yes, how long could it take? Thanks Doctor: Hello. Thanks for posting at Chat Doctor. Enlarged hart on ECG may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy due to high blood pressure. But there are other causes and types of enlarged heart which should be ascertained. I recommend you a 2 D echo of the heart to see what chambers of the heart are enlarged and if there is any leak between the valves. Treatment depends on the findings of 2 D echo. If it can be reversed by diet and exercise, again depends on the 2 D echo findings. Meanwhile since your pressures are found to be high, monitor them regularly for three weeks and if the readings are persistently high, then you should be started on BP medications.

Doctor: Your description of your daughters' problem shows that she has anemia which you think might be sickle cell trait or Thalassemia. First test which can be performed is a reticulocyte count. If this is high it is a hemolytic anemia. A peripheral smear should be done which will make the picture clearer. A bone marrow biopsy can be done to rule out plastic anemia or other bone marrow abnormalities. All these tests will help you to narrow down the diagnosis\",\n",

       "  \"Patient: Good Day! I was recently diagnosed at 21yrs (4months after losing my virginity) with CIN2 after abnormal pap smear and subsequent colposcopy. I have only had sex with 1 person.  I engage in vaginal and oral sex. I want to know what are the chances of having cell changes in the neck region as well? And what is the risk of gettting head and neck cancers from hpv? Also is it safe to still engage in oral sex with my boyfriend at this point (protection or no protection)? Thank you in advance. Doctor: Hi, You said that you have been diagnosed with CIN2. It is an abnormality of cells in cervix that can lead to cervical cancer if left untreated. CIN2 means between 1/3rd and 2/3rd cells in cervix are transformed onto abnormal cells. It is caused by Human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV doesn't lead to any changes in your neck. Certain types of HPV causes cervical cancer and certain types of HPV causes genital warts. HPV does cause pharyngeal cancer. But it generally occurs in males above 40 years of age. So, It's quite uncommon in a young woman like you. No need to worry about it. As you already have developed HPV infection, you need not be worried about getting new HPV infection from your boyfriend. But always make sure to use protection like condoms. They protect you from all kind of sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia, HIV, syphilis, etc. And coming to the treatment part, your gynecologist will perform some procedure like laser therapy, freezing therapy (cryotherapy) to remove the abnormal cells. She might also use LL ETZ (a procedure using a loop of wire) to remove or scrape out the abnormal cells. Also make sure to undergo repeat testing of pap smear and colonoscopy after 6 months of having treatment for your CIN2.\",\n",

Doctor: Hello, Continue to keep the area clean by rinsing with warm salt water. Tissue can go through various stages of healing. Depending on the amount of inflammation, I hope the size will continue to decrease with an additional healing period. I do not think there is an urgent need to see your dentist from your description. Taking Anti-inflammatory medication such as Advil or Tylenol may help you to continue to heal. Consider scheduling a dental visit if the location and size are a functional problem, or you continue to reinsure the area. A clinical exam would determine if a surgical procedure is an option or necessary. There could be excess tissue that could be removed. Thank you for your inquiry.

I had a high fever, chills, dizziness (almost to the point where I passed out), extreme fatigue, slight stomach nausea (no vomiting though).  Any idea what I had? I feel a lot better but am continuing to rest because I still have a little fever and am a little dizzy. Doctor: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. High fever, dizziness,fatigue, nausea with chills could be indicative of some generalized viral infection or might be bacterial infection. But it must be further evaluated by clinical examination and some relevant tests. You should go for some routine blood works, ESR,urine examination for routine and blood electrolytes (sodium, potassium) even though you are feeling a lot better now. You may take over the counter painkillers and antipyretic like Tylenol or ibuprofen along with antihistamines like cetirizine 10 mg for symptomatic relief from your these symptoms. Also, take plenty of water with fruit juices for faster recovery and for symptomatic relief. But the important thing is to rule out infective component by clinical examination and above-mentioned investigations since you still feel mild dizziness and fever. For that, you may need to see some local physician or visit ER who will know about it and may order prescription. If there is some infection detected, then he/she will prescribe you appropriate antibiotic course like 3 or 5 days as per severity of symptoms. Hope this will help you.',\n",

Doctor: Hi.thank you for posting query at Chat Doctor. Further evaluation advised. Ultrasonography is recommended to rule out gall stones. Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder. Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones, though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder-surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid (UCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller (weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy. Hope to answer your concern. Wish you good and sound health.

And remember to check your thyroid levels regularly as advised and follow treatment. Due to the thyroid condition, hair growth will be a little slower than normal. If your hair is very thin and scanty on the scalp, and medical methods do not work well for you, after a few months of observation, certain new surgical procedures can be considered such as PRP, as will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation, if they feel that it will be a good option for you. This is a later option. Also get a good nutritious diet, avoid stress, pollution, get good rest. Hope this guides you.',\n",

Your child complained, and you took him to the eye doctor immediately! Many young child Chat Doctor.  In fact, it is the most common vision defect in this age group.  Normally both eyes line up together. In a lazy eye, one of the eyes deviates, so the eyes do not line up together.  The patch makes a correction so that with time both eyes will line up normally.  If you had not taken your child to the ophthalmologist and his lazy eye wasn't correct, your son would have vision loss. I should think the eye specialist would want to see your son back in 2 months for his first eye check since he got his glasses.

Been going on for about an hour now. I sometimes have trouble with reflux (got if from my dad), could that effect it? Ive been eating pizza... Oh, and Im female, in case that changes anything. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your. Yes, HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) cat cause chest pressure, heaviness and breathing difficulty. HERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest tightness, pressure, heaviness, breathing difficulty etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid fast food like pizza, sandwich, burgers etc. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take antacid like pantoprazole on empty stomach. 5. Go for walking after meals. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

But this pain didnt start until yesterday and it comes and goes and i get numbness to my face. Do you think to could be nerve issues from my adjustments or could it be something more and should i go to the hospital? Doctor: Hello! I read carefully your question. Regarding your concern I think it may be an occipital neuralgia. The numbness of your face may be caused by a hypersensitiveness of the trigeminal nerve in the brain. Cervical column arthritis can also cause this type of neuralgia by compressing the occipital nerve. I would recommend consulting with your GP, have a good neurological examination and a cervical column x-ray. A brain CT scan may be necessary to rule other causes like a brain tumor, which may cause similar symptoms. Hope to have been helpful! Best wishes!',\n",

Doctor: Positioning you jaws by bringing them in front would not give you the correct idea of how your face would look after the correction of your overbite. Correction of overbite would not make your face looks shorter at all it would rather improve your profile. There are ways when the jaws are corrected and positioned differently to align them more aesthetically called distraction oogenesis, but that would be done only if the jaw alignment is improper. In your case a retainer and alignment of teeth would suffice so you needn't think about the jaw surgery unnecessarily. Also, overbite can have LNG term effects in the gums leading to more problems so I would suggest you to start the treatment without any further delay.\",\n",

Doctor: Hello and thanks for using this forum. I am very sorry for your loss. A deviated Nasal septum (DNS) is either post-traumatic like after an accident or congenital that since birth. In either the patient gives a history of obstructed breathing through the nose since birth or since the trauma. The other most likely cause for the nose block that you are experiencing is allergic rhinitis. The allergies in the human body can be due to altered immunity in response to allergens in the environment or mental stress.

Doctor: Hi, Multiple sebaceous cysts over the scrotum is a rare condition but should be promptly treated if infected to avoid complications that can be harmful to your in the future. Best is to consult a surgeon who can examine you and confirm the diagnosis. Once confirmed, a carefully planned surgery must be done to remove the cysts and then probably reconstruct the scrotum using skin flap surgery.

I was in a head lock underneath him when he decided to trip me and bring me to the ground. When we fell, all of his body weight landed on my right shoulder and I instantly felt a swelling sensation. I was still able to movw my arm afterwards but as the shouldwr cooled down it made it impossible for me to move it without assistance. Aboit a year ago I was playing football and threw a ball against the wind. When I did that I felt a small pop in the middle/center parr of my shoulder. I did see a therapist for it and had it fixed. This pain is similar but more intense. My shoulder is not poped out but my rotation is very limited. I have to assist my right arm even when I am laying down. Whether its putting my arm on my stomach or above me it still needs assistance. Whenever I feel I want to move my arm anywhere, I feel I have to battle a tweak inside my shoulder. Would this be a rotater cuff injury or just some swelling that isnt allowing my arm to move yet? I fell like something needs to pop back into place but only slightly. Im told that that feeling is because of the swelling. It also hurts to get up and lay down. I did not ice right away but I did apply salon pas and also tiger balm. Do you have any advice for me? Thank you for your time and help. Doctor: Dear patient There is much possibility of rotator cuff tear or ban kart lesion, both soft tissue injury may occur during sports like wrestling.

Since that time I have been on maintenance chemo. Had a surgery to remove extensive scar tissue and part of the small bowel due to freq. bowel obstructions.

I have a problem which i would like to express it to you.iIam suffering from asthma and headaches daily,also even if i sleep ten hours a day if feel very tired but not fresh.For asthma i take inhalers and for headaches i take medicine but there is no relief for me.So suggest me some tips to keep in control of asthma,headaches and tiredness or to permanently have a cure out of these problems Doctor: Hello, Asthma results in poor ventilation resulting in decreased oxygenation to the whole body and this is perhaps the cause of your headaches. Anyway, you should also exclude other reasons for your headaches like sinus problems, refractive errors etc. It is because of the asthma that you feel tired even after rest. Since you stay in a cool place at high altitude where the atmospheric oxygen concentration is lower, you can use a nebulizer for better relief. Also, steroid inhalers are needed to prevent attacks as they reduce the need for bronchodilators which usually have unpleasant side effects.

       "  'Patient: HI At my last appointment with my heart specialist the doctor increased my dose of Carvidilol (Coureg) to 12.5mg twice per day in the hope that this would decrease the chances of an AFIB event, in fact he said I can eat anything now. Unfortunately over Christmas I had two or three AFIB events each of which subsided after a few hours and where my pulse fortunately never reached over 124 ppm ( at least when I checked it ). The reason for the events was probably due to over indulgence in foods that may have had higher levels of sodium chloride at the same time as drinking a lot of wine and on one occasion brandy. On a normal day my pulse is 49 to 52 in the morning and seldom gets above 65 even after some fairly heavy physical activity. It does go up to mid to high 60 s if I have two or three glasses of wine. Normally of course I am on a very low salt diet as my wife and I make almost everything from scratch ourselves without adding sodium chloride. The reason I am writing is that early March we are traveling to Australia for a month followed by a month cruising back to the US. I don t know whether I will be able to get low or no salt food on board the ship. I m wondering whether an even higher dose of coureg might be advisable during the trip to counter the unknown levels of salt I will encounter on the voyage. Thanx Keith Jones Doctor: Hello, Your dosage or Carvedilol is optimum and increasing it at present is not justified as you already have low borderline pulse (50) at rest and increasing the dose may bring it more low which would cause fatigue and weakness on routine activity. Mostly you would be able to tolerate normal salt in cooking. Just avoid breads, bakery products and preserved food as they have higher salt content. Avoid Bing Chat Doctor.  If you have an Atrial fibrillation episode, taking a higher dose e.g. 25 mg max of carvedilol single dose, would be ok. But taking on routine basis is not a good idea. Also discuss the need for anticoagulation with your doctor on next visit. Regards',\n",

If so, what should I do?  Cant afford fees. Doctor: Ok. there's a nerve from the top of the neck that runs up the back of the head (C-1 nerve). Problems in it cause pain in that location, often triggered by neck/head movement. Taste/smells are from the totally opposite side of the head (nose and the first cranial nerve that runs under the brain near the nose).

Second most common causes include autoimmune diseases such as thrombocytopenia. If this is ruled out by specific tests then some other causes may be considered and some are more or less serious such as Leukemia Lymphoma, or noninflammatory diseases such as acidosis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

I have a few queries Doctor: Hi there, Welcome to Chat Doctor, If your period lasted from 1 to 14 March you have had a prolonged bleeding and might not have ovulated in this cycle. Yes, it is possible that some women do not respond to Good ova (Camphene), these could be due to Camphene resistance or improper use. If you have been diagnosed with PCs delayed periods and an ovulation are common, and it could be due to the same that you have not yet got your period. You need to get proper medication for PCs, Metformin 500 mg twice a day is advisable and can be continued even when you get pregnant. It is not advisable to take thyroid tablets unless you have a documented thyroid deficiency, it will not help you to take it randomly. Diet, exercise and Metformin will help you with the PCs. For ovulation induction with Camphene you need to take Camphene from day 2 to day 7 of the cycle and undergo follicular monitoring from day 9 of the cycle to track the ovulation.Also, Folic acid should be taken by any women trying to conceive. You could take Phaeton to get your period and start Camphene from day 2, after confirming with another pregnant test that you are definitely not pregnant. Hope this helps. Regards.',\n",

You should consult a dentist and get evaluated and get an x-ray of that particular region done to rule out the exact cause of the infection and pain and get treated accordingly. The doctor may perform oral prophylaxis or may prescribe antibiotics along with anti-inflammatory. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.',\n",
       "  'Patient: Hello!Ive been recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia by a rheumatoid arthritis specialist. I recently retired and have been involved in physical fitness all my life. I am having a hard time accepting this diagnosis but have taken it upon myself to talk to a cognitive therapist, been to a chiropractor many times and have become an active yoga enthusiast. I dont enjoy the thought of trying various pain medications for fear of their side effects. I understand there is a blood test called FM/a which identifies markers produced by immune system blood cells with in people with fibro. Is this worth pursuing? My symptoms include pain in both upper thighs (t-bands), chronic stiffness in the neck and shoulder areas. Could this be related to some other underlying condition that hasnt been checked? I am having difficulty with this diagnosis since I have been quite active all my life (60 now).With Thanks Doctor: **1. Since diagnosis is made by a specialist, event then consider second opinion for available options and conservative management.PS. immune marker will help establish prognosis and available options of the disease, thus is worth pursuing.2. Because there is no identifiable because thus treatment is symptomatic, as a result both pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures are used as adjuvant to get a good control of pain and extended symptom free period, such as',\n",

I tried to put the baby toe back in place, it hurt like hell, i taped it to the other toe but i am still having alot of pain Doctor: Hi, You have a fracture in your toe. It needs to be stabilized with a plaster, which will be applied on whole your ankle. Till then, you are not supposed to take weight on the toe or ankle. You need to take rest, apply ice, use a compression bandage and elevate the limb to reduce pain and swelling. If you had been my patient I would have suggested Ibuprofen twice daily for 3 days and then once till pain subsides. Hope this helps you. Hope I have answered your query.

       "  'Patient: My daughter, 15, has anxiety. She s on Prozac, 80 mg and 76 concerta. She has Xanax for attacks. She s very anxious tonight, I see a panic attack coming tomorrow. Will taking Prozac or Xanax help prevent it tomorrow? Will she be too tired in school? Doctor: ! After reading your question I can say from my clinical experience that your daughter is on Prozac (fluoxetine) and concrete (methylphenidate) for her problems, and you have asked if she can be given Xanax to prevent the possibility of a panic attack ... I have seen I my clinical practice that SOS (when needed) use of clonazepam/ alprazolam is effective in controlling agitation. The only thing I ask my patients to keep in mind is sedation (not tiredness) which may develop after taking Xanax.in most of the cases of aggression, or panic attack, the only thing which happens with medicine is that the abortion of attack. Rarely, any patient develops sleep or sedation. But it is always a possibility that she may have lethargy, so, keep a check. If you feel such, ask her to take leave from school for a day.

       "  'Patient: I just pulled something out of my daughter s butt. She is 2 1/2 years old and has been complaining of her butt hurting for a month. They put her on Miralax, but she still complains. What i pulled out of her butt looked like a long piece of pulled beef. It was stringy but lumped together. I ve seen this several times now, but this was the longest piece. Any idea on what it could be? Doctor: Hi, the long stringy thing that you removed could be a tapeworm or any other parasite. This is also the cause of constipation which required MiraLax and is also the cause of pain in the abdomen. Give your child Tablet Albendazole 400 mg single tablet. Repeat the dose after 1 week. She should be alright in a few days. Give her some supplements in form of Complex as infestation leads to malabsorption. Spy A to Z 5 ml twice a day will be helpful. Thanks and regards.',\n",

When I first saw it I thought maybe it could be ringworm. I dont know what I had that thought, but did. Then a few days ago I noticed what looks like small red callouses on top of the same two fingers on both hands. They are not dry, dont burn or itch. This morning, I discovered that I had sllightly round reddish/violet spots (the size of a lemon) in the groin area on both thighs. Again, no burning itching or pain of any sort. I just read something about flesh eating diseases and am worried I may have something like that. I do not take any meds; only vitamins D and B12 (which may be low at this time). Thank you for any information on this. I am getting an appointment with a dermatologist this week, but in the meantime, I am concerned because I have never had or seen anything like this. Its not grotesque or anything, but not narmal. Doctor: Hi, happy to help you on your health concern on part of Chat Doctor!

Please note that, post extraction your dentist would have informed you not to disturb that area as this will impede the healing process.

Since there is no history of intercourse/sexual contact, likelihood of STDs [sexually transmitted disease] is/are ruled out, thus likely possibilities in your case could be.

Doctor: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It is an antifungal and can be used to treat topical fungal infections but if your infection is widespread, it may be better to combine it with a 2 to 3-week course of an oral antifungal.

Towards the end of my cough the left side of my rib started to hurt (about two weeks ago). I had that side of my rib injured before (hairline fracture). Which I think may be a reinjury of some sort due to excessive coughing, however, in the past week this pain had traveled from my left side and extend to my right side also. However, the right side pain is more towards the sternum. I don t feel extensive pain going about my day, just have a hard time getting up in the morning when it hurts the most, and when I have any residual cough. Not sure what is wrong with me, and are there thing I can do to get better? Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis is more. Bronchitis is inflammation of airways. It can cause excessive coughing, asthma like attacks, chest pain on coughing etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.
